# ddos-research-project (Raspberry Pi)

## Overview
This project explores Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks and defense mechanisms using a Raspberry Pi as the test environment. The goal is to **simulate attacks, detect anomalies, and implement mitigation strategies**.  
The final results will be presented at **Scholars Day**.
